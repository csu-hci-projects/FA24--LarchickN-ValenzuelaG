### Steps Toward Completion
To tackle this project, our team created GitHub tasks for each item in the rubric—from ammo pickups to overworld hazards—making a total of 18 tasks. We split the list in half (9 tasks each) and assigned them to each team member, covering everything from gameplay elements to submission requirements, like this README and the YouTube videos.
### Completion Process
With tasks assigned, we gradually tackled each one over the work period. We started with UI-based tasks, knowing that many other assets would rely on having the UI functional first. After that, we moved on to creating assets like targets, health packs, hazards, and ammo packs. Finally, with all the main elements in place, each of us designed a level using the assets. This step-by-step approach helped us cover every rubric component efficiently and thoroughly.
### How To
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: Begin by finding the 'start menu' level, and run the game. Within the start menu you can choose to play or quit the game. Pressing start will guild the player directly to the first level, where a target counter will display requiring you to find and destroy all of the targets on the play field. Beware of the cactus hazards and even a secret DEV easter egg (if you can find it). Scattered throughout the map are ammo pickups if you run out of ammo before destroying all the targets. Once ALL targets have been destroyed, a new menu will pop up, again directing the player to the next level. The second level operates in a similar fashon, as such all targets should be destroyed and the game will end. A final menu will pop up, guiding the player to quit or restart the game. Thank you for playing.
